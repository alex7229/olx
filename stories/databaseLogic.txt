There are at least three collections.
1) All active advertisements
2) Sold items from advertisements
3) Advertisement types

------------- advertisements -----------------

Pretty self-explanatory.
It should contain every accessible data from the web advertisement.

1) Every advertisement which is fetched from the web should be saved.
2) Advertisements which are more than 30 days old should be removed completely.
3) If advertisement is no longer available through the web (deleted by adv. owner) ->
   delete from the collection
4) On activation toggle (adv. owner set active adv. as 'inactive' or vice versa) ->
   toggle it's state in the collection as well
5) Should be updated on web adv. update.

-------------- sold items ---------------------

Should contain advertisement id, price, type.

1) If advertisement was deleted by adv. owner -> put it in the collection
2) If advertisement was set as inactive -> put it in the collection as well.
   But it should be removed from the collection if advertisement is active again.
3) If for some reason item price was changed in adv. collection -> change it in this collection.

---------------- advertisement types -----------

Should contain type (e.g., '1060 6 gigs'), olx url search page and regExp.

1) RegExp: (e.g., 1060 gpu are different by memory size, but are contained
   in the same search page).
   They both have the same url, but different RegExp:
    /1060 3 gb/ and /1060 6 gb/
2) It should be impossible to add document with the type that is already in the collection.
3) Every collection field should be updatable
