Test advertisement uploaded to olx.ua and parsed afterwards

const mainInfo = {
  location: {
    city: "Днепр",
    cityDistrict: "Амур-Нижнеднепровский"
  },
  olxDelivery: false,
  price: 3100,
  promoted: false,
  time: 1502398800000,
  title: "Велосипед горный",
  url: {
    fullUrl: "https://www.olx.ua/obyavlenie/velosiped-gornyy-IDBd1RI.html",
    uniqueName: "IDBd1RI"
  }
};

const details = {
  id: 549829870,
  user: {
    id: "1jqTn",
    name: "Александр",
    phoneToken: "b2681c0352d698b556a6e8b20229a0d9fe05e"
  }
};

It is possible to change location, price, advertisement name, phone number and other
unimportant stuff

On each update change nothing but changed value is changed. For example,
price was changed, but other stuff was unchanged, even time.

On advertisement name change url part was partially changed too.
Previous "velosiped-gornyy-IDBd1RI", next: "velosiped-gornyy-skyland-IDBd1RI"

On deactivation advertisement is not shown in general search (update takes some time)
Advertisement is still accessible directly via url. Html is a little bit different

On reactivation advertisement time is not changed
It seems like the only way of changing adv. time is paying money

On adv. deletion trying to access the advertisement redirects to the page which looks like
"https://www.olx.ua/hobbi-otdyh-i-sport/sport-otdyh/velo/dnepr/#from404"
